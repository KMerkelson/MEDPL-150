	<h1>Reading Reflections</h1>
	<h2>Reflection 1</h2>
	<p>Susan Sontag says that because photography is now a mass art form, it “is not practiced by most people as an art. It is mainly a social rite, a defense against anxiety, and a tool of power” (4). I would say these are accurate descriptions of how I use photography in my everyday life. Every time I hang out with my friends in person, my parents expect me to take a group photo with them. It’s like if I don’t take pictures, it didn’t happen. Sontag says that “To take a photograph is to participate in another person's
(or thing's) mortality, vulnerability, mutability,” and I guess that’s why I feel the need to memorialize images of my loved ones and the time I spend with them—it lets me feel a little less anxious about inevitably losing them. I still wish I had more photos of my grandparents before they passed away, and I once asked my sister if I could take a picture of her just so I’d be able to remember her face. The same reason is also why I spam my camera on vacation. Sontag ascribes the impulse to take pictures as a tourist as a way “to take possession of a space in which [I am] insecure,” but for me it’s not about physical distance—it’s temporal (4). I fear forgetting these experiences, and feel obligated to take pictures of every special moment so I can look at them later and remember the good times. Photography is my defense against forgetfulness and the powerlessness I associate with it. It’s why I resorted to taking photos of the lecture slides in my New Media course last semester, because I didn’t trust my notetaking abilities to be adequate. But image making also functioned as a way to connect to my peers in that context, because I shared these pictures on the group chat so that all of us could survive a course where the slides don’t get posted and the exam questions are awful. I send my friends photos of silly things I see for the same purpose—so they can share in the experience of laughing at funny vanity plates or ugly McMansions, bringing us closer even when we can’t be physically together.</p>
	<p>In terms of how I could visually represent notions of our world at the moment, I think I want to use images and text to highlight the mundane. I think there’s a lot of parts of our daily lives that are really absurd—whether in a lighthearted or fucked up way—when you actually take the time to think about them, but we take them for granted and don’t look at them. I want to create an interpretation of the world that places its frame on those overlooked things, because my viewer will find significance in my choice of subject simply for the fact that it is in a photograph and therefore somehow worth capturing. For instance, I’ve always been used to how uneven the sidewalks in Forest Hills are, but I think if I showed someone a photo of them with the caption “There’s A Retirement Home In My Neighborhood,” maybe they would think about how hilariously inaccessible these giant cracks are to anyone (e.g. the elderly) in a wheelchair.</p>
	<h2>Reflection 2</h2>
	<p>First of all, I do have to take issue with Malik’s phrasing. In her introduction to the article’s topic, Mailk contrasts “real pictures and footage of the world as it is” with “AI slop, low-quality content.” First of all, AI images and videos are not necessarily “low-quality”—they have become increasingly realistic as generative AI becomes more advanced, eliminating some of the more obvious tells like extra fingers. The assumption that AI slop is low-quality is a dangerous one, because it lets people assume that they can tell on sight if something is real, rather than encouraging them to actually question the content and information. Not to mention, this dichotomy also implies that human-made pictures and footage can be trusted to be accurate representations of reality, when this entire class is about teaching us how to manipulate pictures to make them look different. You don’t need AI to Photoshop someone into your Twitter post.</p>
	<p>Beyond that, I find that I agree with Malik’s points in general. I don’t have much experience with political AI content, but I have noticed how it exploits the attention economy. A lot of YouTube channels use AI to make crossover videos, putting characters from one media property in another. There’s also AI voice generators that get people’s attention by letting you listen to someone, real or fictional, say something funny and/or offensive or sing a song or whatever (e.g. Ronald Reagan saying “I love the gays”). In both cases, the central conceit is dangling popular franchises and celebrities in front of people’s faces like jingling keys at a baby, and I’m ashamed to say it’s worked several times on me.</p>
	<p>Beyond being attention-grabbing, using generative AI is just…easier (or at least it appears to be). Take the description of this fan song,: “I hopped on Suno and speed-wrote a song based on her character in like 15 minutes, and after some messing around with different versions of music pumped out by the AI, I spliced together a few to create this self-declared masterpiece.” Where creating music usually takes hours to days, generative AI offers to let you pump out a “masterpiece” in minutes. Which, of course, leads to nonsense like Netflix trying to get voice actors to agree to let their voices be fed to AI that will be used in movies and TV instead of them, because god forbid we have to pay real people when we can have the computer do it instead. Again, I’ve succumbed to the lure of using AI because it’s convenient—I used it for a project in my Anthropology class, because the professor literally encouraged us to and I was busy. And god knows how many times my eyes have instinctively gone to the AI summary at the top of a Google search, because it seemingly puts all the answers in one easy place.</p>
	<p>Finally, I guess AI is contributing to the unrealness and overwhelming desensitization of our visual palates. However, as I said earlier, the existing human capacity for manipulatively editing and altering images was already potent before AI. While it certainly exacerbated the problem immensely by making the tools easier to access and use for anybody, I don’t think stopping or regulating its usage would end our current misinformation crisis. Furthermore, I’ve found that a lot of the disorientation I’m experiencing these days is based on what actually is happening. As Malik put it, “In the real world, US politicians pose outside prison cages of deportees. Students at US universities are ambushed in the street and spirited away. People in Gaza burn alive.” AI slop doesn’t really feel that much more absurd and insane than our terrible reality, where we are bombarded nonstop with over the top evils that go unpunished and unsolved.</p>
