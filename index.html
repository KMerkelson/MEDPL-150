	<h1>Kacey Merkelson</h1>
	<p>This is my creative statement.</p>
	<p>My most prominent memory of image-making is taking a photo of a bloody pigeon corpse on the
	street. I have a deep and abiding anxiety about death, to the point that I cannot think about it,
	yet something about capturing this perverse experience rendered it manageable and understandable.
	As a writer, I use my short stories to do the same thing to the horrors of daily life. I break down
	and communicate my fears and hopes as someone who is trapped in a white, patriarchal,
	heteronormative society and constantly thinking about the all-consuming passage of time. I hope
	to use media making to enhance my storytelling ability, combining pictures with text to create a
	new experience and finding new ways to communicate my complicated feelings.
	Some influences on my work are memes, popular culture, and the fascinating in the everyday.</p>
	<p>Also I want to be able to get hired for marketing jobs. Sue me, authorship doesn’t pay much.</p>
