	<h2>Reflection 1</h2>
	<p>Susan Sontag says that because photography is now a mass art form, it “is not practiced by most people as an art. It is mainly a social rite, a defense against anxiety, and a tool of power” (4). I would say these are accurate descriptions of how I use photography in my everyday life. Every time I hang out with my friends in person, my parents expect me to take a group photo with them. It’s like if I don’t take pictures, it didn’t happen. Sontag says that “To take a photograph is to participate in another person's
(or thing's) mortality, vulnerability, mutability,” and I guess that’s why I feel the need to memorialize images of my loved ones and the time I spend with them—it lets me feel a little less anxious about inevitably losing them. I still wish I had more photos of my grandparents before they passed away, and I once asked my sister if I could take a picture of her just so I’d be able to remember her face. The same reason is also why I spam my camera on vacation. Sontag ascribes the impulse to take pictures as a tourist as a way “to take possession of a space in which [I am] insecure,” but for me it’s not about physical distance—it’s temporal (4). I fear forgetting these experiences, and feel obligated to take pictures of every special moment so I can look at them later and remember the good times. Photography is my defense against forgetfulness and the powerlessness I associate with it. It’s why I resorted to taking photos of the lecture slides in my New Media course last semester, because I didn’t trust my notetaking abilities to be adequate. But image making also functioned as a way to connect to my peers in that context, because I shared these pictures on the group chat so that all of us could survive a course where the slides don’t get posted and the exam questions are awful. I send my friends photos of silly things I see for the same purpose—so they can share in the experience of laughing at funny vanity plates or ugly McMansions, bringing us closer even when we can’t be physically together.</p>
	<p>In terms of how I could visually represent notions of our world at the moment, I think I want to use images and text to highlight the mundane. I think there’s a lot of parts of our daily lives that are really absurd—whether in a lighthearted or fucked up way—when you actually take the time to think about them, but we take them for granted and don’t look at them. I want to create an interpretation of the world that places its frame on those overlooked things, because my viewer will find significance in my choice of subject simply for the fact that it is in a photograph and therefore somehow worth capturing. For instance, I’ve always been used to how uneven the sidewalks in Forest Hills are, but I think if I showed someone a photo of them with the caption “There’s A Retirement Home In My Neighborhood,” maybe they would think about how hilariously inaccessible these giant cracks are to anyone (e.g. the elderly) in a wheelchair.</p>
