	<p>"Into Darkness"</p>
	<p>This photograph is of a hallway on the second floor of the Thomas Hunter Building. I chose this for this assignment because I found it interesting how the deep shadows and the reflection of the lamps in the glass created the illusion of a corridor stretching onward infinitely. The crown molding on each side of the hall enhances the linear perspective, guiding the viewer to a sense of distance. When I cropped this photo, I used Rule of Thirds and tried to align the lines and intersections with the lights on the sides of the chandeliers in the hall. I also used the Golden Ratio, neatly partitioning the central line of the photograph so each rectangle leads you further down the trail of lights. In the Curves layer, I deepened the shadows to conceal my reflection in the glass, deepening the illusion of an infinite corridor and creating contrast with the reflected lights. I also brightened the highlights overall to punctuate the bright spots in the hallway, but tried to darken some of the side lights that I think came out overexposed. Finally, I added some yellow to the highlights and shadows because this made the glow of the chandeliers warmer.</p>
