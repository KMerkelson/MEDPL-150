	<p>"Elegant Design"</p>
	<p>This photograph is a close-up of the sink in the women’s bathroom on the second floor of the Thomas Hunter Building. I chose this photograph because I think it aligns with my creative ethos of highlighting the noteworthy in the everyday—in this case, the ridiculous and annoying-to-use design of this sink. I took this photo from an angle that lets the eye travel from the top left to the bottom right, starting them off with the suspicious dark spots in the corner and tracing the uneven, perpetually wet slope of the giant porcelain waste of space in front of the tiny hand washing trench. I employed the Golden Spiral when cropping this picture, using an overlay that spirals onto the rightmost faucet, the first thing likely to capture attention. The lack of its corresponding soap dispenser creates a sense of incompleteness and wrongness. In the Curves layer, I brightened the shadows and midtones to make the water on the front of the sink more visible. I also darkened the highlights and increased the level of green overall, making this space feel sickly and disquieting. To heighten that effect, I added a Color Balance Layer where I increased the green in the highlights and the cyan and yellow in the midtones. Finally, I went back to the left corner of the sink, raising its exposure and lowering the green channel to make the dark spots more visible again.</p>
